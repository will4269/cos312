Physics:

simulation programming

PhysX engine

Translation and rotational kinematics

force, torque, drag

physics are highly educated guesses
simulations do not require input
can be wrong
never perfect

----------

Edit->Project settigns->Phsyics settings

Default matterial:

physics material is used in computation

default is frictionless

rubber, ice, wood

Bounce threshold: min velocity to trigger to bounce

sleep threshold: min velocity to continue simualting

contact offset: distance away from faces to collide

default solver: amount of passes per frame of physics interactions
